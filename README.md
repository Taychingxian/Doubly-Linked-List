# Doubly-Linked-List
This C++ code implements a student record system using a doubly linked list. The core idea is that each student's data (ID, Name, Marks, defined in the Student class) is stored in a Node. Crucially, each Node not only holds student information but also contains two pointers: next, pointing to the subsequent node, and prev, pointing to the preceding one. This two-way linkage allows for efficient traversal in both directions and simplifies operations like insertions and deletions, as only the pointers of adjacent nodes need updating, unlike arrays which might require shifting many elements. The list itself is managed by keeping track of the first node, known as the head.

The DoublyLL class orchestrates all operations on this list of students. It starts with an empty list (where head is nullptr). Functions like insertAtFront and insertMiddle demonstrate how new student nodes are integrated by carefully adjusting the next and prev pointers of the new node and its neighbors. Similarly, deleteLast showcases how a node is removed by finding the last element and updating the second-to-last node's next pointer to nullptr, then freeing the memory. Other methods like display, findNode, and calculateAverageAndCount traverse the list using these pointers to access and process the student data held within each node, effectively bringing the doubly linked list theory to life for managing student records.
